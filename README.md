## Website Name and Description
**Farm to Table** </br></br>
 "Farm-to-Table" is an e-commerce platform managed by the Department of Agriculture (DOA) that enables farmers to sell their products directly to consumers online. The site streamlines the selling process for farmers, eliminating the need for intermediaries and helping them retain more of their earnings. For consumers, it offers convenient access to a wide range of fresh, farm-grown products delivered straight to their doorstep.

## Project features
The website offers a user-friendly interface where all available products—whether poultry or crops—can be easily browsed. Consumers can add items to their cart and have their selections saved throughout their session. Orders can be placed and tracked by status: pending, cancelled, or completed. On the administrative side, admins have the ability to add, update, delete, and retrieve products from the inventory, as well as manage and monitor all registered user accounts on the platform. </br>

## Usage Guidelines
To use the "Farm-to-Table" website, users must first register or log in to browse and purchase available products. Items can be added to the cart, saved during the session, and checked out with real-time order tracking. Admins should regularly update the inventory and manage user accounts to ensure a smooth and secure shopping experience. </br>
